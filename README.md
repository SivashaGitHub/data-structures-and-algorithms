# Reverse a List
Write python code to reverse a list of array numbers entered while executing the code.

---

## Challenge
Do not use any inbuit python function for "reverse a list" program.  

---

## Approach And Efficiency

First get the length of array value as input.
Run for loop that as many time as length given on input to get the array values as input to array  
Save all the input values into the array variable
Write a python function to accept the arguments as given list.
Read the existing array values one by one on revers order and save it to new array using while loop 
print both  inputted array values and reversed array values.

# Insert Shift Array
Write python code to insert a number into existing array on the appropriate index and show the latest array values.

---

## Challenge
Do not use any inbuit python function for "Insert shift Array" program.  

---

## Approach And Efficiency

First assign 4list values into array variable.
ask user to input the number to insert on the array, provide hint to user to provide the number between first and last value of array.
Write a python function to accept the arguments as list and input number.
Run while loop and assign each array value into new array, also on each iteration check the inputted value is between current array value and previous array value, if yes insert the input number as well on the array.
Print the latest array value and ensure which has new input number as well.

# Array Binary Search
Write python code to search the index value of an array, if the provided serach value avaiable on array.

---

## Challenge
Do not use any inbuit python function for this program.  

---

## Approach And Efficiency

First get the array value in sorted order and the search value as input.
Write a python function to accept the arguments as given list/array and integer number.
Read the existing array values by using binary search algorithm and check wither the search value matches with, if yes return the respective index. 
call the function with array value and search value and ensure correct index is returned.
